## Q: Is `JSX` mandatory for React?

A: `JSX` is not mandatory for React. While `JSX` is a popular `syntax extension for JavaScript` that makes it easier to `write` and `understand the structure of React components`, we can use plain `JavaScript` to achieve the same results. `JSX` allows us to write `HTML-like code within our JavaScript`, which gets transpiled to regular `JavaScript` by tools like `Babel`.
#### Example of `JSX`:
```js
  const greet = <h1>Greetings</h1>;
```

## Q: Is `ES6` mandatory for React?

A: `ES6` (ECMAScript 2015) is not strictly mandatory for `React`, but it is `highly recommended`. `React` can be used with `ES5 syntax`, but `ES6` provides many features that make working with `React easier and more efficient`.

## Q: `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in `JSX`.

A: The Difference is stated below:

- `{TitleComponent}`: This value describes the `TitleComponent` as a javascript expression or a variable or React element.
  The `{}` can embed a javascript expression or a variable or React element inside it.
- `<TitleComponent/>` : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms `TitleComponent` a function that is returning a JSX value. If component is written inside the `{<  />}` expression.
- `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` : `<TitleComponent />` and `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` are equivalent only when `< TitleComponent />` has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.

#### Example

```js
<TitleComponent>
    <FirstChildComponent />
    <SecondChildComponent />
    <ThirdChildComponent />
</TitleComponent>
```

## Q: How can I write `comments` in JSX?

A: `React comments` in `JSX` differ slightly from comments in standard `JavaScript`. Comments in `JSX` must be enclosed in `curly brackets {}`.

#### Example

## Q: What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?

A: In React, `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and its shorthand syntax `<></>` is a feature that allows to `group multiple elements without adding extra DOM wrappers`. Useful to return `multiple elements` from a `component's` render method without `extra containers`.
- With `React 16.2` and above Fragments we can use a fragment to avoid adding the `extra wrapper`, Fragments are denoted by the special syntax:
`<React.Fragment>` or
`<> and </>` the shorthand

## Without Fragments
Prior to React 16.2, we had to wrap them in a `single parent element`.
#### Example

## With Fragments (Shorthand)
A Fragment is simply an `empty element` that acts as a `container for other elements` without rendering any additional `DOM nodes`.
#### Example

## Q: What is `Reconciliation` in React?
A: `Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components.
React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. Comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation.

## Q: What is `React Fiber`?

A: React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter.
The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of Reactâ€™s reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.
Because Fiber is asynchronous, React can:

- Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in
- Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed
- Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance

## Q: Why do we need `keys` in React?

A: In React, `keys` are a crucial concept when working with `lists of elements`. `Keys` help React identify which items have `changed`, are `added`, or are `removed`, enabling efficient `updates` and `rendering`. Here's why they're needed:
- `Unique identification`: Keys help React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed.
- `Efficient updates`: With keys, React can update only the components that have changed instead of re-rendering the entire list.
- `Preserve component state`: Keys ensure that component state is preserved across re-renders when the list order changes.
- `Reconciliation process`: Keys aid React's reconciliation process, which compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM to determine necessary updates.
- `Prevent bugs`: Proper use of keys prevents subtle bugs related to component state and rendering behavior.
- `Performance optimization`: By minimizing unnecessary re-renders, keys contribute to better overall application performance. 


#### Example

```js

<div key={0}>1</div>
<div key={1}>2</div>
<div key={2}>3</div>
```

## Q: Can we use `index as keys` in React?

A: Yes, we can use the `index as keys` in `React`, but it is generally `not recommended`. Using `index` as `keys` can lead to issues when the order of items changes, as it can cause problems with component state and lead to inefficient updates.

## Q: What is `props in React`? Ways to.

A: props stands for properties. Props are arguments passed into React components. props are used in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.

#### Example

```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Tool name="Chetan Nada" tool="Figma"/> // name and tool are props
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Q: What is `Config Driven UI`?

A: `Config Driven UI` is an approach to building `user interfaces` where the `structure`, `layout`, and `behavior of UI components` are defined using configuration files or data structures, rather than being `hard-coded` in the application's source code.

## Q: Difference between `Virtual DOM` and `Real DOM`?

A: DOM stands for `Document Object Model`, which represents your application UI and whenever the changes are made in the application, this DOM gets updated and the user is able to visualize the changes. DOM is an interface that allows scripts to update the content, style, and structure of the document.

- `Virtual DOM`
  - The `Virtual DOM` is an in-memory representation of the Real `DOM`. It is a concept implemented by libraries like React to improve performance and efficiency in updating the web page.
- `Real DOM`
  - The `Document Object Model (DOM)` is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects.

| `Real DOM`                                                       | `Virtual DOM`                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actual browser DOM (Document Object Model)                       | Lightweight copy of the Real DOM in memory               |
| Represents the webpage's structure                               | JavaScript object representation of UI                   |
| Directly manipulated by JavaScrip                                | Used as intermediary for DOM manipulation                |
| Slow for frequent updates                                        | Efficiently calculates minimal changes needed            |
| Updates entire tree structure when changed                       | Batches updates before applying to Real DOM              |
